The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested langchain-core==0.3.79
    langchain 1.0.3 depends on langchain-core<2.0.0 and >=1.0.0
    The user requested langchain-core==0.3.79
    langchain 1.0.3 depends on langchain-core<2.0.0 and >=1.0.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
